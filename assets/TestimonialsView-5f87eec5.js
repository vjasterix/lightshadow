Peter helped me feel safe, giving me the space to feel as though I was in charge of the healing process when I really needed to be. I felt heard. It was great that he could adapt the healing as we went along, in response to what was coming up for me. He intuitively picked the perfect moments to step in and provide reassuring, confident leadership and guidance in a firm and gentle way. My favourite moment was when he got me up and moving, dancing, stretching. It helped me get out of my head and shift the way my body was instinctively responding to old trauma stories. Ever since this healing, I’ve been feeling strangely calm, and able to be there for myself during stressful times, instead of freezing up and acting helpless. I’ll definitely be rebooking. It’s wonderful to find a wise and gentle healer I feel safe with!"}]})},h={class:"container"},f={class:"row"},m={class:"lead"};function u(i,g,p,w,_,y){return e(),t("div",h,[n("div",f,[(e(!0),t(r,null,l(i.testimonials,(a,v)=>(e(),t("div",null,[n("blockquote",null,[d(s(a.testimonial)+" ",1),n("p",m,s(a.name),1)])]))),256))])])}const b=o(c,[["render",u]]);export{b as default};
