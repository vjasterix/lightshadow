I create a safe space that is free from judgement where we can feel comfortable letting those uncomfortable feelings come out, release that tension from the body and feel understood. There&#39;s alot of healing in simply feeling heard and validated with someone who is empathically skilled in holding space.</p></div><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12"><img src="'+i+'"><h3>Insight</h3><p>Finding that penny drop moment of insight is such a relief! Lets shine a light on the complex maze of our beliefs, actions and thought patterns. I often will use card readings to &#39;cut through the noise&#39; and really bring into focus the narrative that is playing out. And I also draw from accumulative &#39;tried and tested&#39; wisdom as a student of philosophies and world views to help frame our narrative into something we feel empowered in.</p></div><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12"><img src="'+n+'"><h3>Clearing</h3><p>Lets revitalise and rebalance the flow of Chi in our physical, emotional and energetic field. I have been a practitioner of the energetic and healing arts for over 20 years, in many different techniques and modalities. The narrative I like to use when describing Chi is to imagine that our physical, mental and emotional bodies were connected by energetic &#39;river&#39; (Chi). If there are blockages in the river then the water isn&#39;t flowing naturally and has become dry, stagnant or sludgy. Or perhaps some sections of the river are turbulent and have a lot of pressure like rapids or floods. A person who has learnt to listen to and manipulate Chi can clear away the debris and allow the energy circulate freely - much like a healthy waterway.</p></div><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12"><img src="'+s+'"><h3>Compass Setting</h3><p>When we are going through tricky periods in our life our arrow tends to be pointing to the past, and we might feel a bit daunted about what might be happening ahead in our life. Compass setting is about turning that arrow around and having a really clear direction that makes us feel like we are now moving forward. We do this by finding creative and easy tasks and activities that can be utilised to really help cement the learnings going forward.</p></div></div></div>',2);function l(d,h){return r}const g=e(o,[["render",l]]);export{g as default};
