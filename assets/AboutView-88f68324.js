I&#39;m down to earth approach to matters relating to personal development and spirituality. But I&#39;d like you to know who I am:</p><p>As far back as I can remember, I have had a curious mind that liked to understand what life and the world all meant. I was introduced to harnessing the power of my creative mind at a young age at a seminar called Alpha Dynamics. This gave me a good grounding into the science and philosophy of the mind, and a window into the world of self healing and self actualization. I carried on with this later in life with interest in philosophy, psychology and physics; always curiously exploring different ways to view and understand the world around me. In my 20&#39;s I was introduced to Reiki, an energetic healing modality that I would practice with myself and friends, and develop further by exploring the tools and philosophy of the eastern mystics.</p><p>I learnt and practiced tools and techniques from as many philosophies, sciences and art forms as I could, finding commonalities among them, and crafting the pieces I found most useful into my own open minded world view that didn&#39;t require allegiance to any one particular ideal.</p><p>I kept alot this learning to myself, but I noticed that the more learning I absorbed, the more people would come to me when they found suffering in their life. And, I noticed that I was able to help them using the wisdom, tools and techniques I had cultivated over the years.</p><p>I found, <b>there is no feeling I love better than helping others</b>, and so I looked towards opening a small Reiki clinic in my 30s. I found alot of joy working towards that goal, but I also found alot of struggles that made me realise I wasnt ready for this step. In 2020 I reconnected with Healer, Author and Naturopath <a href="https://omanisa.com/">Omanisa Ross</a>, who became my mentor. She helped me identify the pitfalls I was experiencing in my abandoned venture, helped me refocus on my purpose to help others, and took me on as an apprentice to learn the craft of healing that she had learnt through decades of practice.</p></div></div><div class="row" id="training"><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h3>My purpose is to collect wisdom and techniques for growth, and to share that with those who can benefit from it::</h3></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h3>Healing Practises</h3><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item">Gaian Healing apprentice (3 years study)</li><li class="list-group-item">Reiki Practitioner ( 20 years )</li><li class="list-group-item">Golden Dragon (Ashati)</li><li class="list-group-item">Violet Flame</li><li class="list-group-item">Polyvegal therapy</li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h3>Working with Young People</h3><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item">Holds a current Working With Children Card</li><li class="list-group-item">Is a Youth Mentor with Sparkways</li><li class="list-group-item">Has been a Youth Guardian</li></ul></div></div>',2),r=[l];function d(h,c){return t(),i("div",n,r)}const m=e(s,[["render",d]]);export{m as default};
